;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put extract-text.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(cl-defun extract-matching-rectangle (start end &key (incstart t) (incend t)

  "Extract a rectangle of text from the current buffer.
The rectangle can be specified in several different ways:

 1) By passing corner positions to :START and :END (see `extract-rectangle')

 2) By passing regular expressions to :START and :END which match strings delimiting the
    corner positions. If the regexp contains any non-shy subexpressions, the first one will 
    be used for determining the start/end match.
    By default the matched strings will be included in the rectangle. To exclude the matched 
    start/end text so the rectangle starts/ends after/before the matched text you must set 
    :INCSTART and/or :INCEND to nil (they are t by default).
    The search for matching strings will start from the beginning of the buffer/string 
    unless the :STARTPOS argument is supplied giving the start position.

 3) By a mixture of the above two methods.

 4) By specifying just one of :START or :END (as a position or regular expression), 
    and also specifying the number of :COLS and :ROWS of the rectangle. 
    If COLS or ROWS is negative then the columns/rows are counted in the opposite 
    direction to normal, i.e. backwards from START position or forwards from END 
    position. This allows you to specify the rectangle from any corner position.

By default regexp searches for start and end positions will start from the current cursor
position up until (point-max). If STARTPOS is supplied then searches will start from that 
position instead, and if ENDPOS is supplied they will not pass that point.
If no matching rectangle is found then an error is thrown unless :NOERROR is non-nil."

;; The START argument should be a regexp matching the line before the first line 
;; of the block, or if INCSTART is t, the first line of the block.
;; To define the rest of the block you can either supply a MATCH argument, or
;; an END argument, both of which should be regexp's.
;; The MATCH argument should match each line of the block between START and

;; should be a regexp matching all lines in the block after start, or an END 
;; argument which should be a regexp matching the line following the block.

;; or the last line of the block if INCEND is non-nil.

;; If any of the regexp arguments contain non-shy parenthesised subexpressions 
;; then the string matching the first non-shy subexpression will be used to determine
;; the position rather than the whole match.

;; The CHECK argument can be used as an extra check of the lines in the block:
;; if it is 'left then only left aligned matches are accepted,
;; if it is 'right then only right aligned matches are accepted,

;; This library provides functions for programmatically extracting text from buffers.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put extract-text.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(cl-defun extract-matching-rectangle (tl br &key (inctl t) (incbr t) rows cols noerror)
  "Extract a rectangle of text (list of strings) from the current buffer.
The rectangle can be specified in several different ways:

 1) By passing corner positions to TL and BR (see `extract-rectangle')

 2) By passing numbers between 0 & 1 to TL and BR indicating corner positions as a 
    fraction of the buffer size, e.g. 0.5 represents the midpoint of the buffer

 2) By passing regular expressions to TL and BR which match strings delimiting the
    corner positions. If the regexp contains any non-shy subexpressions, the first one will 
    be used for determining the tl/br match.
    By default the matched strings will be included in the rectangle. To exclude the matched 
    tl/br text so the rectangle starts/ends after/before the matched text you must set 
    INCTL and/or INCBR to nil (they are t by default).

 3) By passing cons cells in the form (regex . rep) to TL and BR. In this case the
    rep'th match to regex will be used for the start/end position.

 4) By a mixture of the above methods.

 5) By specifying TL & BR using one of the above methods and setting COLS to t
    in which case all columns of all lines between TL & BR will be included.
    The return value will be all text between TL & BR split at newlines and
    put into a list. Note: this is not necessarily a rectangle exactly.

 6) By specifying TL & BR using one of the above methods and setting ROWS to t
    in which case all rows of all columns between TL & BR will be included.

 5) By specifying just one of TL or BR (as a position, regexp, or cons cell), 
    and also specifying the number of COLS and ROWS of the rectangle. 
    If COLS or ROWS is negative then the columns/rows are counted in the opposite 
    direction to normal, i.e. backwards from TL position or forwards from BR 
    position. This allows you to specify the rectangle from any corner position.

If no matching rectangle is found then an error is thrown unless :NOERROR is non-nil."
